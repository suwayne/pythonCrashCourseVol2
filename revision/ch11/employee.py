"""
Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method should take in a first name, a last name, 
and an annual salary, and store each of these as attributes. Write a method called give_raise()
that adds $5,000 to the annual salary by default but also accepts a different raise amount.
Write a test case for Employee. Write two test methods, test_give_default _raise() and 
test_give_custom_raise(). Use the setUp() method so you dont have to create a new employee instance 
in each test method. Run your test case, and make sure both tests pass.
